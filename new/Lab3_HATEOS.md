# **HATEOAS Driven Banking Services with Spring Boot**

## **Use Case: Savings Account Management**

Modern banks are continuously evolving to provide better digital experiences to their customers. One such experience is the dynamic discovery of banking operations and services. HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) in RESTful services can be pivotal in achieving this. In this lab, we'll implement a "Savings Account Management" service using Spring Boot and HATEOAS. This service will allow customers to view their savings account details, as well as discover related operations dynamically.

## **Lab Setup in Gitpod**

### **1. Open Terminal in Gitpod**

If not already open, launch the terminal from the Gitpod interface.

### **2. Install JDK 17**

Set up JDK 17 for our project by entering the following in the terminal:

```bash
sdk install java 17.0.8-oracle
sdk use java 17.0.8-oracle
```

### **3. Navigate to the Project Directory**

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you'll set up the project:

```bash
cd /workspace/spring-boot-java/savings-account-service
```

### **4. Initialize Your Spring Boot Application**

Using the Spring Initializr, create a new Spring Boot project:

```bash
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -o savings-account-service.zip
unzip savings-account-service.zip -d savings-account-service
cd savings-account-service
```

### **5. Integrate Spring HATEOAS**

Edit the `pom.xml` file to include the Spring HATEOAS dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### **6. Implement Savings Account API with HATEOAS**

1. Create a SavingsAccount entity.
2. Implement a SavingsAccountController with CRUD operations.
3. Enrich responses with HATEOAS links.

Here's a basic implementation:

```java
// SavingsAccount.java
@Entity
public class SavingsAccount {
    // Attributes like id, accountNumber, balance, etc.
}

// SavingsAccountController.java
@RestController
public class SavingsAccountController {

    @GetMapping("/savings-accounts/{id}")
    public EntityModel<SavingsAccount> retrieveAccount(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Fetch account details and enrich with HATEOAS links
    }
}
```

### **7. Testing the HATEOAS Driven Service**

Run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/savings-accounts/1` to see the account details enriched with HATEOAS links.

## **Bonus Challenge**

Now that you've understood the basics of implementing a HATEOAS-driven service with Spring Boot, challenge yourself:

1. Envision a new banking use case, such as "Credit Card Management".
2. Design the entities and operations related to this use case.
3. Implement the service, ensuring to enrich responses with HATEOAS links.
4. Test the service and share your implementations with peers for feedback.
